The deep learning A-Z course is very good for the beginner/advanced level. Step by step process is explained very precisely. All the practice materials are provided to get better hands-on practice. The instructor is highly knowledgeable about the topic. Highly recommend this course...Thank you.</p>","rating":5,"created":"2022-10-31T01:17:32-07:00","like":67,"dislike":9,"user":{"name":"Aamina Ko","avatar":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png"}},{"content":"<p>This course was totally amazing!

I just wish there was an easier explanation initially for how to get the data. At the beginning of the course you are given multiple links and some are not quite relevant and it gets confusing. I prefer how the videos tell you, when you need it, where the data is. </p>\n\n<p>I really love the complentary links from SuperDataScience and the ability to have these videos in written form so I can follow along instead of just listening, and also have the resources written down. </p>\n\n<p>This course simple explains the different kinds of neural networks and the exercises that help you combined supervised and unsupervised models are much appreciated. Great effective intro that really can get you started, and sets you up to learn more.</p>","rating":4,"created":"2022-11-21T03:50:57-08:00","like":69,"dislike":9,"user":{"name":"Vanessa Vidal","avatar":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png"}},{"content":"<p>Very nicely composed to give an intuitive flavor of the subject till most recent advancements.

This course will take you from absolute beginner with TensorFlow, to creating state-of-the-art deep learning neural networks and becoming part of Google's TensorFlow Certification Network. </strong><br><br>TensorFlow experts earn up to <strong>$204,000 USD</strong> a year, with the average salary hovering around <strong>$148,000 USD</strong> according to 2023 statistics. By passing this certificate, which is officially recognized by Google, you will be joining the growing Machine Learning industry and becoming a top paid TensorFlow developer!&nbsp;If you pass the exam, you will also be part of Google's TensorFlow Developer Network where recruiters are able to find you.<br><br>The goal of this course is to teach you all the skills necessary for you to go and pass this exam and get your TensorFlow Certification from Google so you can display it on your resume, LinkedIn, Github and other social media platforms to truly make you stand out. <br><br><strong>Here is a full course breakdown of everything we will teach <em>(yes, it's very comprehensive, but don't be intimidated, as we will teach you everything from scratch!)</em>:</strong><br><br><em>This course will be very hands on and project based. You won't just be staring at us teach, but you will actually get to experiment, do exercises, and build machine learning models and projects to mimic real life scenarios. Most importantly, we will show you what the TensorFlow exam will look like for you. By the end of it all, you will develop skillsets needed to develop modern deep learning solutions that big tech companies encounter. </em><br></p><p><strong><br>0 — TensorFlow Fundamentals</strong></p><ul><li><p>Introduction to tensors (creating tensors)</p></li><li><p>Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes)</p></li><li><p>Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)</p></li><li><p>Tensors and NumPy</p></li><li><p>Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)</p></li><li><p>Using GPUs with TensorFlow</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong><br>1 — Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow</strong></p><ul><li><p>Build TensorFlow sequential models with multiple layers</p></li><li><p>Prepare data for use with a machine learning model</p></li><li><p>Learn the different components which make up a deep learning model (loss function, architecture, optimization function)</p></li><li><p>Learn how to diagnose a regression problem (predicting a number) and build a neural network for it</p></li></ul><p><br><br><strong>2 — Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn how to diagnose a classification problem (predicting whether something is one thing or another)</p></li><li><p>Build, compile &amp; train machine learning classification models using TensorFlow</p></li><li><p>Build and train models for binary and multi-class classification</p></li><li><p>Plot modelling performance metrics against each other</p></li><li><p>Match input (training data shape) and output shapes (prediction data target)</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong><br>3 — Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow</strong></p><ul><li><p>Build convolutional neural networks with Conv2D and pooling layers</p></li><li><p>Learn how to diagnose different kinds of computer vision problems</p></li><li><p>Learn to how to build computer vision neural networks</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use real-world images with your computer vision models<br></p></li></ul><p><strong><br><br>4 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 1: Feature Extraction</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn how to use pre-trained models to extract features from your own data</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use TensorFlow Hub for pre-trained models</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use TensorBoard to compare the performance of several different models<br></p></li></ul><p><strong><br><br>5 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 2: Fine-tuning</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn how to setup and run several machine learning experiments</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use data augmentation to increase the diversity of your training data</p></li><li><p>Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained model to your own custom problem</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use Callbacks to add functionality to your model during training</p></li></ul><p><strong><br><br>6 — Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling Up (Food Vision mini)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learn how to scale up an existing model</p></li><li><p>Learn to how evaluate your machine learning models by finding the most wrong predictions</p></li><li><p>Beat the original Food101 paper using only 10% of the data</p></li></ul><p><br><br><strong>7 — Milestone Project 1: Food Vision</strong></p><ul><li><p>Combine everything you've learned in the previous 6 notebooks to build Food Vision: a computer vision model able to classify 101 different kinds of foods.

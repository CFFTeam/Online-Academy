I have also completed Max's Web Dev course and I really enjoy his method of teaching, but for this particular course especially in the later sections, it is often difficult to follow along because a lot of the code doesn't fully work anymore, often to the point that it is distracting me from the primary goal of learning to develop apps with Flutter. Thankfully, there are a lot of people who are of great help in the Q&A sections that helped me complete this course to the end. I do believe Max will be updating this course in the near future though, so I will be looking forward to that!</p>",

I understand that some of this is good practice but the entire second half of the course was waaaaay outdated.</p>\n\n<p>My time could have been better spent.  FWIW, I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and was here to learn Flutter as I have a project coming up where Flutter may be the way we go.  I have over 12 years as an iOS developer and architect so I come in at a pretty high level.  </p>\n\n<p>One of the man concerns we have with Flutter is how often it changes and many of those changes can really break existing code.  Be careful with your upgrades!</p>\n\n<p>That's my main complaint. I'm sure this was a great course two or three years ago and if it gets a true update (to version 3.x of Flutter), then it would be 5 stars.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Jonas is a good teacher, but this course is deprecated and yet it is advertised as for 2023.  This is not honest advertising, as it's become very clear by looking at the comments on sections where I ran into major issues because things simply weren't working the same way as the instructor showed, that many of these lessons are at least 2 years old, and seemingly more than that.  Beyond that, the course material is organized in a different file structure than Jonas', which has led to hours of frustration.  That being said, the course is more in depth than you find most places, and covers really a lot of material.  I can't say it wasn't worth the purchase, but I really think this needs some work, and the labeling is not good.</p>",

Once I tried implementing Mapbox and Stripe, everything flew out the window. Errors after errors. Bad request, cross-origin problems, can't create a Stripe Session, etc. It is very frustrating to spend 70-80 hours following along with an app taught by an excellent instructor only to see it fail at the finish line. I have purchased many Udemy courses and on a whole they have all be great and a bargain at any price. Jonad knows his s@@t better than anyone else on the platform. My critique is more about web-development in general than the course or instructor. Imagine the English or French language changing every 18 months. How would we communicate with anyone? It's Babel in the true sense of the word. Three years ago the app worked and students were satisfied. But for a new coder in 2022, taking a web development course will require an equally long JEST debugging class because nothing works as expected. This is like college before auto-save was a word function. You'd spend hours on a thesis, term paper, what have you. Have a momentary power surge and everything you worked on was lost. Web development, React, Next,  Redux, Python, these are all unique and syntax specific computer programming languages. Forget to close a template literal or miss a comma and your work crashes. I learned many things but not how to fix the never ending list of JS errors. I have been invited to the restaurant, shown the menu, but not allowed to eat. M</p>",

Now I am not sure if I can say that for this one because I am sure Jonas is good teacher, and you get to learn a lot of things in this course. The only issue why I gave 3.5/5 is the course needs to be updated. There were so many places in between the course where Jonas's code wasn't working for me (because of the changes in packages in updates) and I wasted so much hours trying to fix them. It was really frustrating tbh. Also QnA section is dead, Assistants don't reply to our queries, thanks to students who are there to help, they are saving so much of our time. So I will say it's high time now Jonas should update his course, it's been 3 years, there are so many bugs in the course.</p>",

My goal with this course is to not be totally lost, armed with a data science cheat sheet.  I might suggest that you advise 'basic math and algebra skills' as a prerequisite, and perhaps (LOL) 'the willingness to learn a foreign language.'  If I walk away with enough to build a block of code, with enough background to use google and a cheat sheet to get me there, then I'm happy.  I'm hoping to acquire sufficient background knowledge, with this course, to be able to do that.  I do think, however, that your course is better suited for someone seeking a higher threshold than I am.</p>",

I consider that that part should have been a new small project and not try to push everything in one project...starting a project as its supposed to be its quite important in planning an app<br>6. the auth part just shows poor programming and lazyness...</p>",

I feel like this course has a lot of value and gives you a very good base to start you mobile development journey from. Ofcourse there are things that could be optimised and there were also things that I would have done or would have written differently, but that doens't mean it's a bad course.  <br>Programming is a very broad field that has so much information that may or may not be relevant to you and in this course you get a pretty good clear cut understanding of where and how to get started. </p>\n\n<p>Keep up the good work.</p>",

Be that as it may. This course has made me really fun. And everyone who knows me knows that I learn a lot and am very critical. You can tell that he is really interested in explaining the subject matter to his students in an understandable way.  He takes the time to draw everything and explain it slowly and very precisely. My respect for people who focus on their students.</p>",

The course had so many things that were unnecessarily complicated things added to itself, that weren't properly explained in my opinion. If you need to learn the basic theory of AI, this is something good. However, if you need anything that learns you how to implement it, or that learns you how the AI works (with numpy, rows, etc.) you definitely need a lot of preknowledge. I'm a bit disappointed with this course. Hence the two stars.</p>",

The programming exercises are really good if you try and implement your own code along side with the instructor without looking at the videos, but only listening to the audio of him explaining the reasoning behind the code. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, this course is pretty dope.

It is too frustrating that topics that can be explained in 5 minutes are explained in 15 minutes repeating the same over and over again, leading to ambiguous explanations.

They use old versions of the libraries and it was impossible for me to install them after losing so much time trying.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, like in other courses of these instructors, Q&A is completely useless and all of the assistants seem bots that don't know how to answer any question.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I wasn't the only student with that problems because others had commented the same problems in the lessons. There are even questions with these problems asked years ago.

Rather than just discussing theories and ideas, the instructor provided real-world examples and case studies that helped to illustrate the concepts being taught. This made the material much more relevant and engaging, and helped me to better understand how the concepts could be applied in a practical setting.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their skills and knowledge in the subject matter. It was well-organized, well-taught, and provided a wealth of valuable information. I feel confident that I will be able to apply what I learned in my professional life, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken such a high-quality course.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey everybody! I will write a long review for you.<br> I juuuust managed to finish this bootcamp that i started a little bit less then 6 months ago.<br>My only preview experience was another Udemy Course, a free one, HTML + CSS 4hours, so basically no previous knowledge so you will find my review from this point of view.<br>First. My rating 1/5 Doesn't reflect the real value, is just a WARNING for you(future students), for Angela and her team. The course is shamefully outdated (it has 828547 participants!!!!, tons of money made!!!) in key chapters, BUT Angela is a very nice teacher, sweet person and sweet voice, gave us a lot, a lot of priceless informations and i totally recomand her, but i want to make a comparison. Year 2000 film camera vs 2022 DSLR cameras, the one in year 2000 was good at that time, but is not up to date to with the actual tehnologies and i will try to give you a preview of different chapters.<br>This course covered a lot of topics and in the same time i feel like we didn't made a deep learning in any of them. <br>I start with a comparison, the free course that i have made before gave me more infos then Angela in first 5 sections.<br>Then section 6. Bootstrap, sadly..it was outdated.<br>Also i feel like we didn't practiced enough to sediment the infos in bootstrap, javascript, jQuerry, <br>Section 21 Git also very outdated, lost few hours to figure out how to login<br>Section 25 SQL, we almost did nothing in it.<br>Section 33 React. She registered when was React 16.8, now is 18.1+ the syntax is diferent(ok, no big deal) but i gave up and coded like her in 16.8 otherwhise i had to lose a lot of time and focus changing at every leason, small details but will annoy you for sure.<br>I choose this bootcamp because had a lot of hours of it, what i saw in comments a lot of important things were not mentioned like other Hooks (we only learned useState), no flexbot, no grid.<br>Until section 33 the course was registered between 2018 and 2019.<br>What was updated for Year 2022 was only section 34-39 (Web3, BlockChain, Crypto Token/Coin, NFTs) that i feel had to be in a totally separate Course, sure it was in trend, the blockchain, crypto, nfts were exploding and was a good marketing thing (meanwhile at the end of 2022 everything is down ^.^). Anyway this chapters were very very very rushed, just few challanges , you just can watch her coding.</p>\n\n<p>Another important thing and i saw a lot of people writed in reviews: Sadly the front-end is not connected to back-end to really build a proper website! The concept is called MERN, look for it!</p>\n\n<p>A funny part is that i started a 2022 bootcamp and i finished a 2023 one =) great! <br>Again, WARNING! has nothing in it updated for 2022-2023 yet.<br>And another WARNING, watch out on Udemy style too. You cannot filter the reviews by date, they just put them \"random\"(or not) 6 months ago, 3 days ago, 2 years ago and so on, it would be great to sort them by the most recent, most upvoted, most recommanded, like in the course, but they specially made it like this to catch you.</p>\n\n<p>BUT overall i don't regret doing this course, i really got a lot of infos for very few euros.</p>",

In other words, the course materials are outdated in a sense. I also hate how instead of just showing that instead of just showing the proper way to do something the first time, you'll re-type the code 3-4 four times as way of demonstrating how not to do it. It's best the incorrect ways of coding not even be in our memory to begin with, what she does is just waste a lot of time.</p>",

Let me break this down:</p>\n\n<p>5 stars <br>None of this course deserve 5 stars, Some free courses provide much better experience than this one.</p>\n\n<p>4 stars<br>Javascript, Jquery, React deserves 4 stars. it really help me a lot, better than some courses out there.</p>\n\n<p>3 stars</p>\n\n<p>2 stars</p>\n\n<p>1 stars</p>\n\n<p>deserve no stars</p>\n\n<p>I didn't pay only for html and css plus there are a lot of free resources that provides better formula and impact than this one.</p>\n\n<p>The backend segment was a fiasco, Nodejs and express is meh, helpful but not. again, there are other better free resources out there. I was so excited about learning sql but you won't learn much of it and you won't even use it. the api's, Mongodb and below is horrendous. Most of the course are SOOOOOOOO outdated that I couldn't even proceed without going through the documentation and trying to make sense of all the crazy jargons.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you can get a job after this course, well think again. I've gone through interviews and have to take different courses because this course couldn't even get me pass the minimum, you won't learn how to handle payments, you need to learn both sql and mongo if you are working on a project that requires both, and most of them do to separate vital and non-vital data.</p>\n\n<p>1 star is for : Awful, not what I expected at all. I would rate a negative if it's available. don't be fool by the date, please do not be fool by the date, I repeat do not be full by the date. PLEASE PLEASE pay a little bit more because this course is wasting more of your time than saving it.</p>\n\n<p>and if you want to buy on udemy, buy courses that won't evolve with time such as arts or languages.  tech and other stuff are changing so fast, so it's not worth saving a hundreds of dollars and losing hundred of hours.</p>\n\n<p>have a good one.</p>",

When she does update, it's only a change of website but doesn't actually include any instruction. She obviously only cares about the paycheck from the class and not teaching anyone real-time skills. DO NOT waste your money on this course unless you only want to learn about the computer technology from 2018 and nothing about today's technology.</p>",

They are relatively poor compared to front-end contents.<br>- Should provide clearer demonstration on Web3.<br>!!! A large portion of contents are outdated and caused a painful amount of confusion to my learning experience. <br>NOTE to new comers to this course: usually those outdated stuff have answers or corrections in the Q&A section, but if not, go to Google and StackOverflow. Take this as an exercise of dealing with similar frustrating conditions in the real-world. <br>However, the fact that this will happen at work doesn't mean it's okay to not providing students with what they were expecting when purchasing a course called \"web dev 2022\" instead of \"web dev 2019 + Web3 dev 2022\". Afterall, this course is a commercial product and students have rights as customers. That's why I'm only giving 2.5 stars despite of me listing so many pros. If I hear that this course is updated to what it should be, I'll immediately change my rating to 5 stars which it could have deserved.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Tl;dr: This course is great, I highly recommend it for anyone either completely unfamiliar, or even with some experience, with JavaScript that wants a comprehensive foundation of knowledge that they can be confident will serve them well.</p>\n\n<p>Having just finished this course, I must say it is fantastic. I have been working with JavaScript professionally for two years in my role as a SysAdmin, creating automations for different business processes from automatically processing employee account lifecycles, (creating new accounts for on-boarding, keeping them up to date with info changes, and processing off-boarding) to keeping asset inventories up to date, and pushing commands to devices remotely (such as lock commands for lost devices). </p>\n\n<p>I've had to leverage different data types and structures, control operations/methods, and HTTP requests to various APIs quite a bit so felt fairly comfortable in my knowledge set, but was entirely self-taught via quite painful trial and error and spending hours and hours combing through documentation. Honestly, my knowledge and skills were rather patchwork and I was using some quite antiquated coding technique, so I decided to take this course to fill in a lot of gaps and develop a much more solid foundational understanding of JS, especially more modern ES6 features and techniques.</p>\n\n<p>This course absolutely delivered and is what I wished I had when I was first starting to hack together my first rudimentary JS scripts. Jonas, over the course, builds from the very basics of syntax through to teaching how to build a front end web application with rather sophisticated features in a very thorough, methodical, and systematic way with a knack for explanation that is understandable and enlightening.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the greatest strength here is that Jonas goes out of his way to not just hash out some code and say what it does, but actually delves into how things work and reinforces and builds on this knowledge as the course progresses so nothing that you are doing on any of the several projects seems hidden inside a black box.</p>\n\n<p>Even with my prior work and experience in JS, I can say that my knowledge and skills, as well as confidence, has grown an order of magnitude and I consider this a tremendous return on my investment in Jonas's course and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a solid foundation in JS from which to continue to grow. I am looking forward to taking a few more courses that Jonas has here on Udemy, as well as developing some of my own projects and heavily refactoring all my previous code.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to Jonas for this course, truly appreciate the level of detail and attention he has put into it.</p>",

Everything is well covered, plenty of useful info, I really don't have anything bad to say. </p>\n\n<p>The quality of the content is dropping as we are approaching the end of the course. The Mapty project was really interesting, but in things started to get messy. </p>\n\n<p>The final project - Forkify - was a mess. Yes, I am a novice programmer and I didn't expect to just easily walk through the final project, but the Forkify lesson should be re-made from scratch. The MVC architecture was not well explained in the MVC lesson, so I bet plenty of people just started copy/pasting the code after passing the MVC lesson. It took some time for the famous \"a haaaa\" moment to happen in my brain. My advice to you would be to add a new project to the course, after Mapty and before Forkify. In that project people should practice how to import/export a bunch of modules & classes. Five .js files could be enough for that program, before increasing their number to 10,15+.<br>The call-stack, event loop, runtime environment and closures could all be much better explained. I saw some amazing videos about those topics on YT that helped me understand those concepts and mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>I will rate this course as average / could be better (3). <br>Forkify is like and an anchor that is pulling the grade of this course down. Redo it please, not for me, but for future people who are starting with JS. </p>\n\n<p>Jonas, thank you, I really learned a lot about JavaScript from this course, I really appreciate it.</p>",

Of course, I will need more practice before I can say that I am comfortable with JavaScript, but by reviewing course notes and doing some research, I can implement most of the concepts that were taught. I really liked the broken-down structure of the course. It was easy to follow and to return to previous sections for a quick refresher when required. The projects are excellent to practice the theory. Jonas is an outstanding teacher and conveys the message clearly. Feedback was clear, and I usually got an answer to my questions within 24hrs from any of the TAs.  </p>\n\n<p>It took me a bit of time to complete this course. I did it in two chunks, breaking about half-way for a long period of time, and I don't recommend doing that. This is because each learning objective builds on previous ones, and it's hard to pick up this course again from the middle when you are no longer fluent in the JS language. I also took time to understand, take good notes, do side projects/challenges, and do so research or reading on the subject. So it took me just over a year to complete, including about 8 months break in the middle. It is hard work IMHO and totally worth it!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Date: 3 Nov 2022<br>TLDR: I recommend the course.</p>\n\n<p>NEGATIVE (UDEMY issue): I hate that they start asking for reviews after the first video. It must drive instructors crazy. It would be nice if we could see (and search/sort by) how far a reviewer was in the course, when they left their review. Many reviews seem to be from people who clearly didn't finish the course or get far into it at all. I have finished this course.</p>\n\n<p>NEGATIVE (UDEMY issue): The English captions are ok, for the most part. However, there are a lot of mistakes in them. I wish I had access to them, I'd have fixed them along the way.</p>\n\n<p>English is my first language, but I always use subtitles, in any event. I didn't find Jonas hard to understand. Jonas speaks slowly and clearly. (So slowly I did the course at a higher speed) For people like my wife, who have English as their second (or more) language the subtitles should be better. It seems the English subtitles were manually created, so when considering the problems in them, I really fear for what the auto-generated other languages look like.</p>\n\n<p>HARD NEGATIVE: I would have liked to join the Discord group, but it requires my phone number. Firstly, I don't have a smart phone. Even if I did, I wouldn't be giving out my phone number. Most of my own family doesn't even have my phone number! Not having a smart phone does not mean I'm not a human being, fully capable of contributing to society! I'm a member of many discord communities, and I've never seen this requirement before. I personally consider it a violation of privacy, and would never consent to such a thing. I don't have the ability to participate in his discord, and I removed an entire ‚≠ê from my rating, for this, alone. It‚Äôs a shame since I own all of his courses.</p>\n\n<p>NEGATIVE: I didn't really care too much for his style of continually adding more and more code to a section, and in the end leaving one big mass of code with everything commented out. I feel like that makes it more difficult when you return later to look for something you want to review. I personally used my own system to create sections in individual files, to keep track of things, but the mass of code in one file with huge sections commented out as we go, drove me nuts.</p>\n\n<p>NEGATIVE: The section on Git, is the very last section in the course. I think students would benefit from having it very early on. Maybe even in the first set up sections, so that we could be using it all along, and become comfortable with its use throughout the course. This with multiple files throughout the course and keeping the code \"cleaner\" as we work through the lessons would benefit students more, I think.</p>\n\n<p>POSITIVE: There are quite a few coding exercises and a challenges. I'd have liked more! You don't learn by watching videos, you learn by doing. Over and over. I don't think you can have enough exercises and challenges. If you do them, and make sure you fully understand the topic, before moving on, you'll get the most from the course.</p>\n\n<p>POSITIVE: Jonas put a ton of time and effort into the course. If you take the time to UNDERSTAND the topics before you move on, there is a lot to learn. Don't be afraid to use external resources (MDN, stack overflow, W3schools, YouTube, etc.) to strengthen information you are weak on. Sometimes having something explained in a different way can drive it home. I'm sure even Jonas has to look things up. </p>\n\n<p>NEUTRAL: JavaScript supports both object-oriented programming with prototypal inheritance as well as functional programming. While functional programming is touched on in the course, that's about it. If the course ever gets another major overhaul, I'd really like to see functional programming more central to the content.</p>\n\n<p>I think the title is a misleading. You're not going to be an expert after this (or any single) course. You can't learn a language by watching videos. You have to SPEAK the language. Same thing here. You have to work at it. It's not going to magically sink in. </p>\n\n<p>This is a JavaScript course, which includes some HTML/CSS. Those are not the focus of this course. Neither are databases or any back-end content. Jonas has other courses for those things. Perhaps I'll leave reviews on those as well, when I finish them.</p>",

All of them were small projects for the current section (nothing fancy or special) and I was disappointed that we don't have a bigger final project combining multiple sections with lots of features worthy to put in your portfolio.<br>4. The pace. In some sections/lectures you were jumping with some already done code and components saying 'we already made this'.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest one in my opinion again is your way of teaching.

Thank you!! But sometimes you take quite a long time explaining those extra info that made me confused as to what to really focus on. I think you should leave those info at the end of each lecture.<br>- If possible, can you and your team host those big projects (order app, quote loggers, etc.) so students who want to try the challenges without your guidance can compare their work?</p>",

However, after attempting the developer exam after your course, you cover a lot of extra, superfluous things that are not on the exam, while not covering core, key concepts that would have been more helpful on the exam. More time should be spent on LSTMs, different types of nlp classification, and time series. You should also go into more detail about ways to increase accuracy, such as dropouts, batch normalization, and how the types of layers you show actually work. The exam is tested on how well the models do, and in most sections of the course, none of the models perform all that well. In your fashion mnist example you only build a model that is 90% accurate, but you can get it to 99%, so if that came up on the exam, using the techniques you showed would not garner a passing grade. If you intend for this course to be enough for someone to pass the exam you need to cover things more in depth and show how to get models performing at the highest caliber possible.</p>",

You dont have to follow along if you dont have to\" This is the worst.. You give 1 lecture explaining how to do something, the next you change the entire if/else setup into something else because of own preferences, either causing confusion to beginners because youre changing things around or causing it to be overcomplicated.</p>\n\n<p>Very very demotivating to continue the quiz-game section of this course, this is not the first bad experience i have in this section with this teacher,  but this is the one that went over the edge in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Like come one.. If he gets payed to do this, that is a literal waste of money XD.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on to Tilevania</p>",

It teaches you the both the editor and c# scripting. <br>In particular Rick is a very, very good teacher. He goes over things in a good pace and also explains everything well. <br>Both Gary and Rick also to make sure that nothing is assumed and show what they ask you to do and do it themselves so you can follow along if you get lost.</p>\n\n<p>My main critique is Gary's lessons - I think Gary also has a good pace, and also makes sure to demonstrate a lot that he does, but I found when he was doing certain things with scripting in particular I got really lost. Like he uses certain terms or words in scripting and just assumes that you know if he created his own variable or if it's something that already comes with unity etc etc.<br>I also think Gary does really well, but he does have the more harder content to demonstrate, so in that regard he's fighting uphill with harder content which isn't fair on him to be the fall guy for those two sections.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I think these directed lessons helped me more than any undirected youtube series has and now I feel set up for any future udemy courses or even undirected youtube tuts. <br>In the end I definitely dont feel ready to make my own simple game yet but I'm confident I can get there now.</p>\n\n<p>If you're wondering whether the course is worth it, the TLDR is YES - it's worth the money and it stops you wasting time on youtube that is less focused.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks guys and I'll be onto the next course !</p>",

It is worth every cent that I have spent.</p>",
